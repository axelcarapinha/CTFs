# MyCTFs
Collection of CTFs I had fun making!

## Goal
This represents _not_ just an opportunity for me to learn, but also an effort to foster more enthusiasm for cybersecurity within the community.

## What areas are used here?
Until now:
- Cryptography (encryption, cryptanalysis, ...)
- Linux terminal commands

# Sidenote
Feel free to send me your proposed solutions!
Also, I can confirm if the answer that you found was the one I pretended (I'm still learning, in the end).
